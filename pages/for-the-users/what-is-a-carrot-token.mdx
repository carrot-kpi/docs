subtitle: Get started with Carrot and what it's all about.

Carrot is a platform that enables flexible and efficient incentivization,
rewarding what really matters to you in a capital efficient way. Whether you're
a protocol or a single user, if you need to reach a goal by incentivizing a
certain behavior, Carrot can help.

## How it works

Incentivization in Carrot is enabled through what we call **KPI token
campaigns**. At a high level, **KPI token campaigns** are made up of the
following concepts:

-   **Goal**: each KPI token campaign defines a goal to be reached and for which
    efficient incentivization is needed.
-   **Condition**: the goal needs to be turned into a condition so that Carrot
    can correctly assess if it was reached or not. This is a simple step that
    will be described in more details later in the documentation.
-   **Collateral(s)**: collaterals are the rewards given out to the campaign
    participants if the goal is reached. Logic related to collateral(s)
    unlocking is template-specific (the concept of templates is addressed later
    in the docs).
-   **KPI tokens**: KPI tokens represent a claim to all or part of the
    collateral whenever the goal is either fully reached or partially reached.
-   **Oracle(s)**: oracles are used in Carrot to relay condition outcomes
    on-chain from the real world once they are known, allowing for the
    finalization of the KPI token campaign.

Some of these concepts are on-chain entities and implemented through the use of
templates, which enables Carrot to be extremely flexible in implementing
incentivization strategies that work great for every possible use case. The
concept of templates is expanded in the next section.
