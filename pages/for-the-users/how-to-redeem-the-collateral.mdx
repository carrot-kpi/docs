title: KPI tokens
subtitle: KPI tokens implement incentivization strategies.

KPI tokens and their templates are the main piece of logic in Carrot, the ones
that have full control over the incentivization strategies.

They represent on-chain the condition that the user wants to incentivize and the
collateral(s) it can take. They have attached oracles that relay information to
them regarding condition outcomes.

Based on these outcomes, they can freely decide what to do about the
collateral(s) and where to allocate it.

In this sense, KPI tokens are the heart of any KPI token campaign.
