    Templates are the basic building block through which all incentivization
    functionality is implemented in Carrot.

## A high level overview

The Carrot protocol itself has zero built-in functionalities, and every single
added feature is built on top of the core set of smart contracts as an
independent template, which can be defined as a mini-app that run inside of
Carrot, abide by its rules, and extend its functionality.

Templates are independent from each other, interchangeable (they can be freely
mixed and matched together) and orchestrated by the Carrot frontend, which gives
to the end user a unified and coherent experience hiding away the complexity and
flexibility of the platform.

This type of architecture gives an unprecedented amount of flexibility to Carrot
and extreme freedom to implement new tailor-made incentivization logics and even
full custom clients dedicated to specific templates.

## The template structure

Templates are composite entities made up of an on-chain contract(s) and an
off-chain frontend and are trustlessly stored on-chain through dedicated smart
contracts that fully manage the entire lifecycle of each template (addition,
versioning, updates, upgrades\*, instantiation, deletions).

\*: **when we mention upgrades, we mean for future uses of a certain template.
Template instances that have already been deployed and are in use are always
trustless and immutable in Carrot.**

Following is a list of the informations stored on-chain for each template:

-   **ID**: each template has a well-defined auto-incremental integer identifier
    inside of Carrot to correctly handle operations such as upgrades.
-   **Version**: Carrot templates can be upgraded and expanded in their
    functionality (or patched if needed), so each template has a version that
    indicates how many updates have been done to it.
-   **Address**: an address that points to the template's contract. The on-chain
    part of the template logic is implemented in this contract, and any template
    instance will be a minimal proxy to this address.
-   **Specification**: the template specification contains metadata about the
    template in a JSON file along with its frontend implementation (itself made
    up of multiple parts). More details will be given in a dedicated section of
    the docs dedicated to the template specification.

Templates only represent a certain logic's **definition** and in order to
actually be used in a KPI token they have to be instantiated. Instantiation of a
template is done through its manager contract and at a high level consists in
deploying a minimal proxy to the template's contract (as mentioned above).

## Specific types of templates

There are 2 main types of templates that can be implemented in Carrot:

-   **Oracle templates**: as the name implies, these templates are meant to
    implement logic that can bring real-world data regarding the outcome of a
    specific condition on-chain. Some examples of what can be implemented span
    from leveraging crowdsourced oracles such as Reality.eth and UMA's
    optimistic oracle to get generic-purpose data to more "static" oracles such
    as ChainLink based ones to bring a predefined set of data on-chain. These
    templates interact with KPI tokens once an outcome related to a condition
    becomes known and needs to be relayed to the KPI token itself (we'll go more
    in depth on the concept of KPI token later in the doc).
-   **KPI token templates**: KPI token templates implement logic strictly
    related to how KPI tokens behave, what kind of collateral they accept, what
    their shape is (KPI tokens can be ERC20, NFTs or more), how many conditions
    (oracles) they can handle, how they will interpret the results relayed to
    them by attached oracle templates and more. The various incentivization
    strategies offered by Carrot are actually implemented in the form of KPI
    token templates.

In the next section we'll explain in a more detailed way the structure of an
oracle template, its role in Carrot, and the possibile features that can be
implemented in it.
