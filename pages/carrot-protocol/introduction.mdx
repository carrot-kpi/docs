subtitle: Learn how to get the most out of the Carrot dapp.
---

The Carrot dapp allows users to interact with or create new incentivization
campaigns using the officially registered templates.

It acts as an orchestrator to the various registered templates, and as such
you'll actually be interacting with the templates themselves and not the dapp
most of the time. Carrot however does everything in its power to make the
templates concept transparent to the user to offer a consistent and simplified
user experience.

This documentation is subdivided in 2 parts, one detailing how to perform
generic actions on the dapp, and one that details instructions to correctly
interact with the various different templates available:

-   Generic documentation
-   ERC20 KPI token template
-   Reality.eth v3 oracle template
