subtitle: Exploring the Features of the Carrot Orchestrator
---

The Carrot Orchestrator, as the base Carrot dApp, enables users to interact with
Carrot templates. It serves as an orchestrator for these templates, offering the
following key pages:

## Homepage

The homepage of the orchestrator consists of three distinct sections:

-   **Informative Video and Hero Section**: When no featured campaign is
    present, the homepage showcases an explanatory video that highlights how
    Carrot simplifies incentivization.
-   **Featured Campaigns**: At times, the Carrot team may feature campaigns from
    partners, which will be prominently displayed at the top of the homepage.
-   **Latest Campaigns**: The subsequent section presents the five most recent
    campaigns. These listings are continually updated, providing a quick
    overview of ongoing activities in the Carrot ecosystem.
-   **KPI Token Templates**: This section offers a selection of KPI token
    templates that allow users to create campaigns. Note that the availability
    of this section depends on whether multiple templates are deployed on the
    network. If only one template is deployed, the section will not be visible
    by default.

## Campaigns Page

The campaigns page provides a user-friendly interface to browse through created
campaigns. Users can optionally filter campaigns by state (active, expired, or
finalized) or search for specific text. Additionally, campaigns can be sorted in
ascending or descending order based on their creation dates.

These two main pages form the core functionality of the Carrot Orchestrator. The
subsequent sections will delve into the details of interacting with the official
first-party Carrot templates, which users typically engage with the most on the
Carrot dApp.
